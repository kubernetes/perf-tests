      # We modify interval depending on the cluster size to avoid collecting too many samples for
      # large clusters. Also because the tests run longer in bigger clusters we don't need to
      # collect them as often as in smaller clusters. For example if in 100 node cluster the test
      # takes 10min it's useful to gather metrics every 30s. On the other hand if the test takes
      # 10h collecting metrics every 5min is still good enough. The expression below should give us
      # 30s interval for small clusters (up to 500 nodes), 2.5min interval for 2K node clusters and
      # 5.5min interval for 5K node clusters.
