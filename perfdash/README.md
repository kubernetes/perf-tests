# Kubernetes Perfdash

Kubernetes Perfdash (performance dashboard) is a web UI that collects and displays
performance metrics. Performance metrics are created based on performance test
results for different nodes numbers, platform types and platform versions.

Perfdash is available at http://perf-dash.k8s.io/

## Supported metrics

* Responsiveness
* Resources
* PodStartup
* TestPhaseTimer
* RequestCount
* RequestCountByClient

Metrics above are available for all kinds of tests divided into load and density subtypes.

## Application server

Application server runs as a deployment on kubernetes cluster. It is hosted on
*mungegithub* cluster in *k8s-mungegithub* project.

## Application images

Images are stored in *gcr.io/k8s-testimages* project container registry.


## Local development

First, ensure godep is installed using `go install github.com/tools/godep`.

To test your changes locally, execute `make run`. It will build the binary and
start perfdash website at <http://localhost:8080>. Note that it might take a
short while for perfdash to start since it needs to fetch the job artifacts first.

You can alter startup parameters (like number of jobs for which history is fetched)
by editing the makefile.
